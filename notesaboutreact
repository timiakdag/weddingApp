some state tells the app and what the data on the screen is

trigger state changes into the UI

want architecture w/ APIs react doesn't care about it

clean architecture design -> separate data layer and UI layer

REACT query -> when the component gets rendered and fires off request.  Data code is in your UI, build high order components and hooks 

State management -> use REDUX & ZUSTAND 

Web app not for achieving a goal
